India 5Years Districtwise Dataset (2018-2022)
* **Scope:** India district-level dataset covering annual missing-person cases from 2018 to 2022
* **Geography:** All districts and union territories, including reorganized areas (e.g., new districts in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana)
* **Demographics:** Counts by gender (male, female, transgender) and age groups (children vs. adults)
* **Age-Band Harmonization:**

  * **2018–2020:** Seven detailed age bands (<5, 5–14, 14–18, 18–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60+)
  * **2021–2022:** Four consolidated age bands (<12, 12–16, 16–18, 18+)
* **Data Cleaning:** Removed summary rows (e.g., “Total\_Districts”), standardized column names, and corrected naming inconsistencies
* **Feature Enrichment:** Integrated auxiliary socio-economic variables (e.g., population, literacy, poverty rates) for per-capita and weighted analyses
* **Readiness:** Fully preprocessed and normalized, ideal for unsupervised clustering and supervised hotspot prediction tasks
